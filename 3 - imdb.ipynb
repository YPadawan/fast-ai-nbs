       "'This is a extremely well-made film. The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate. The music is good, too, though it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are no really superstars in the cast, though several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script.<br /><br />But it is hard to watch, because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There is some merit in this view, but it\\'s also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends.<br /><br />The result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black-and-white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope for change in the younger generation.<br /><br />There is redemption of a sort, in the end, when Puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life, but also truly loved her, and her family which has disowned her, then later come looking for her. But by that point, she has no option that is without great pain for her.<br /><br />This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults, and also that both can be dignified and caring people. The reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching, since there can never be real reconciliation across the India/Pakistan border. In that sense, it is similar to \"Mr & Mrs Iyer\".<br /><br />In the end, we were glad to have seen the film, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. If the UK and US could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness, they would certainly be better off.'"

       " \n",
       "  xxmaj if you want to look at this film as a \" nit - picker \" you can find many little flaws within it . xxmaj but to focus on that is missing the point entirely . xxmaj why even view the film , in that case , because we know there will be no such robots , at least not by 2005 ? xxmaj for me , the film works very well and i will remember it for a long time .,xxbos xxmaj though it runs only seventy - five minutes , it still seems remarkable that xxmaj buster xxmaj keaton 's fertile imagination is built upon short , quick gags that pass by quickly -- so quickly that it staggers the mind that anyone could come up with enough to flesh out seventy - five minutes . xxmaj the gags themselves are gracefully athletic and consistently come unexpectedly , given xxmaj keaton 's slight build and features that make him look old beyond his years . xxmaj he plays a train engineer whose attempts to join the xxmaj confederate army are rebuffed ( as are the affections of his beloved , believing him to be a coward ) but who almost single - handedly manages to win a major battle by using his train to confound the xxmaj union army . xxmaj there 's great attention paid to detail -- quite a bit is happening both in the foreground and the background of the frame -- and the jokes are both laugh - out - loud funny and amusingly ironic ; but xxmaj keaton 's genius is his ability to isolate the individual within the crowd and draw out that individual 's endearing strengths -- his connection with each member of the audience is subtle but sublime .,xxbos xxmaj okay , so the first few seasons took a while to get going on the special effects way , but from the beginning , xxmaj hidden xxmaj frontier has given consistently good story lines and performances , and have always been willing to mistakes they 've made . xxmaj they advice people to see newer episodes first , so they can see just how good the show is , and understand how much it has changed since the first episodes . xxmaj the cast have a fantastic camaraderie and it shows on - screen . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the influx of guest actors who make their mark on the show and with fans attests also to the show , as the story lines go from strength to strength . xxmaj the show has pushed barriers with its various story lines - depression , drug addiction and mainstream homosexuality - and these may have rubbed a few people the wrong way , but that is what xxmaj star xxmaj trek is and was all about . xxmaj it portrays those story lines in a smart and emotional way , dealing with them subtly and smoothly . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj yes , they have used some characters from xxmaj trek history , but they have done them justice - characters like xxmaj shelby , xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj xxunk , vastly underused in the show , had a rebirth in the xxmaj new xxmaj frontier books , but they lost their sizzle after a while , when xxmaj peter xxmaj david when more towards wild fantasy versus serious sci - fi , and xxup hf shows those characters in a completely different light , which serves them better . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the site also allows fans to interact with chat rooms and forums and they can get to know the people involved . xxmaj they release bloopers for every episode , so the fans can see what a laugh they have , because they are people doing it in their spare time , with a dedication that would make many professional actors wide - eyed in shock ! \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj what this series , now drawing to a close after 7 years , has accomplished on such a limited amount of resources is nothing short of amazing - bringing people together , inspiring others to do the same . xxup hf will live for a long time after it ends , as long as people still enjoy the reason it started in the first place .\n",

       "  xxmaj if you want to look at this film as a \" nit - picker \" you can find many little flaws within it . xxmaj but to focus on that is missing the point entirely . xxmaj why even view the film , in that case , because we know there will be no such robots , at least not by 2005 ? xxmaj for me , the film works very well and i will remember it for a long time .,xxbos xxmaj though it runs only seventy - five minutes , it still seems remarkable that xxmaj buster xxmaj keaton 's fertile imagination is built upon short , quick gags that pass by quickly -- so quickly that it staggers the mind that anyone could come up with enough to flesh out seventy - five minutes . xxmaj the gags themselves are gracefully athletic and consistently come unexpectedly , given xxmaj keaton 's slight build and features that make him look old beyond his years . xxmaj he plays a train engineer whose attempts to join the xxmaj confederate army are rebuffed ( as are the affections of his beloved , believing him to be a coward ) but who almost single - handedly manages to win a major battle by using his train to confound the xxmaj union army . xxmaj there 's great attention paid to detail -- quite a bit is happening both in the foreground and the background of the frame -- and the jokes are both laugh - out - loud funny and amusingly ironic ; but xxmaj keaton 's genius is his ability to isolate the individual within the crowd and draw out that individual 's endearing strengths -- his connection with each member of the audience is subtle but sublime .,xxbos xxmaj okay , so the first few seasons took a while to get going on the special effects way , but from the beginning , xxmaj hidden xxmaj frontier has given consistently good story lines and performances , and have always been willing to mistakes they 've made . xxmaj they advice people to see newer episodes first , so they can see just how good the show is , and understand how much it has changed since the first episodes . xxmaj the cast have a fantastic camaraderie and it shows on - screen . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the influx of guest actors who make their mark on the show and with fans attests also to the show , as the story lines go from strength to strength . xxmaj the show has pushed barriers with its various story lines - depression , drug addiction and mainstream homosexuality - and these may have rubbed a few people the wrong way , but that is what xxmaj star xxmaj trek is and was all about . xxmaj it portrays those story lines in a smart and emotional way , dealing with them subtly and smoothly . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj yes , they have used some characters from xxmaj trek history , but they have done them justice - characters like xxmaj shelby , xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj xxunk , vastly underused in the show , had a rebirth in the xxmaj new xxmaj frontier books , but they lost their sizzle after a while , when xxmaj peter xxmaj david when more towards wild fantasy versus serious sci - fi , and xxup hf shows those characters in a completely different light , which serves them better . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the site also allows fans to interact with chat rooms and forums and they can get to know the people involved . xxmaj they release bloopers for every episode , so the fans can see what a laugh they have , because they are people doing it in their spare time , with a dedication that would make many professional actors wide - eyed in shock ! \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj what this series , now drawing to a close after 7 years , has accomplished on such a limited amount of resources is nothing short of amazing - bringing people together , inspiring others to do the same . xxup hf will live for a long time after it ends , as long as people still enjoy the reason it started in the first place .\n",
